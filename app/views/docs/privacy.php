        Privacy Policy

    <div class="fi">
        Your privacy is critically important to us. At <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> we have a few 
        fundamental principles:
    </div>
    <div class="docs_paragraph">
        <div class="docs_paragraph_inner">
            * We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services 
            that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
        </div>
        <div class="docs_paragraph_inner">
            * We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, 
            develop our products, or protect our rights.
        </div>
        <div class="docs_paragraph_inner">
            * We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation 
            of one of our services.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="docs_paragraph">
        It is <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?>'s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while 
        operating our websites.

        Website Visitors
    </div>
    <div class="docs_paragraph">
        Like most website operators, <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> collects non-personally-identifying 
        information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, 
        language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. 
        <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?>'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is 
        to better understand how <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?>'s visitors use its website. From time to 
        time, <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> may release non-personally-identifying information in the 
        aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
        <br/>
        <br/><?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> also collects potentially personally-identifying information 
        like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments. 
        <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the 
        same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, 
        except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the 
        administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

    <div class="docs_category">
        Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
    </div>
    <div class="docs_paragraph">
        Certain visitors to <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?>'s websites choose to interact with 
        <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> in ways that require <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> to 
        gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that 
        <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, 
        we ask visitors who sign up for sketchbook.cafe to provide a username and email address. 
        <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> collects such information only insofar as is necessary or 
        appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?>. 
        <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> does not disclose personally-identifying information other than 
        as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, 
        with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

        Aggregated Statistics
    </div>
    <div class="docs_paragraph">
        <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. 
        For instance, <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> may monitor the most popular threads on sketchbook.cafe. 
        <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> may display this information publicly or provide it to others. 
        However, <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> does not disclose personally-identifying information 
        other than as described below.

        Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
    </div>
    <div class="docs_paragraph">
        <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> discloses potentially personally-identifying and 
        personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated 
        organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on 
        <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?>'s behalf or to provide services available at 
        <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?>'s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. 
        Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home 
        country; by using <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?>'s websites, you consent to the transfer of such 
        information to them. <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> will not rent or sell potentially 
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, 
        contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> 
        discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to 
        a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> 
        believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of 
        <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?>, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered 
        user of a <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> website and have supplied your email address, 
        <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, 
        solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with 
        <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs 
        to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. 
        If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), 
        we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us 
        support other users. <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> takes all measures reasonably necessary 
        to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially 
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

        A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's 
        browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> uses 
        cookies to help <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> identify and track visitors, their usage of

        <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers 
        should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?>'s websites, 
        with the drawback that certain features of <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?>'s websites may not 
        function properly without the aid of cookies.

        Business Transfers

    <div class="docs_paragraph">
        If <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?>, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the 
        unlikely event that <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, 
        user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. 
        You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> 
        may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

        Privacy Policy Changes

    <div class="docs_paragraph">
        Although most changes are likely to be minor, <?php echo $privacy['site_name'];?> may change its
