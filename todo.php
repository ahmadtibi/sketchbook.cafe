*   Site or Forum Statistics on the bottom of the forum?

        Site stats can be: # of members, # of threads, # of posts
        Newest User



*   Forum Shoutbox? Kappa

        Probably shouldn't implement a forum shoutbox - I mean it's a forum and people should
        create forum threads and topics..

        Maybe if we create a profile page we can implement profile shoutboxes? Something similar
        to DeviantArt?

*   Fixme: Admin list - seriously make a better looking design.. it's awful!



[Thoughts and Considerations]
*   Should profile pages be simple pages like on a forum? Should it be more complicated like DeviantART?
    Or should it be more like tumblr?

    Should we allow users to follow users? Get update notifications?
    If notifications, DeviantART style, tumblr style, or pixiv style?

    DeviantART:     They have a neat message center where you can delete updates and notifications
                    BUT most of their server's resources (CPU) is the message center.

    Tumblr:         Tumblr has an interesting notification center where it can duplicate posts and send
                    them to your followers. Just requires a server-side process to manage instant updates
                    Also creates a loooooooot of rows

    Pixiv:          The easiest to implement since they don't necessarily have a message center like DA.
                    Instead you get a page to display all your artists gallery from recently updated.
